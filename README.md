Great! Let's take a look at the content of the `utils.ipynb` file you uploaded and prepare a suitable README for your GitHub repository. I'll start by loading the notebook to understand its content.

The first cell and the first markdown cell of your notebook both contain the text `# Plot Image function`. It seems like your notebook might be focused on a utility function for plotting images. 

Based on this, I'll create a draft README file for your GitHub repository, including a brief description, instructions for usage, and any necessary setup.
